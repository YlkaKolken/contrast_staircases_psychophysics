# contrast_staircases_psychophysics

Dragging the RUNME.py into the psychopy runner will allow this code to run. 
You will see a GUI and click run staircase -> choose parameter file. This parameter file can be newly made or you can use the test.spf.
Since there is no eye tracker you cannot see the white fixation dot without it, which is still to be tested in the lab.
